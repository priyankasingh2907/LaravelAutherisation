# Laravel Authorization & Middleware Project

This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of authorization and middleware in a Laravel application. The focus is on demonstrating how to manage user permissions and protect routes using Laravelâ€™s built-in authorization features and custom middleware.
## Tech Stack

- User Authentication: Utilizes Laravel's authentication system to manage user registration, login, and logout processes.
- 
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implements RBAC to restrict access to specific routes and functionalities based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
  
- Custom Middleware: Develops custom middleware to enforce various checks and conditions before granting access to certain parts of the application.
  
- Policy Classes: Uses policy classes to authorize actions on specific models, ensuring fine-grained control over user permissions.
  
- Route Protection: Applies middleware to routes and route groups to secure the application endpoints.
  
- Dynamic Permissions: Allows for dynamic assignment of permissions to roles and users, providing flexibility in managing access control.
## Features

- Laravel Framework: The primary framework used for building the application.
